# How to Contribute

**The Neuko Wiki is built by the community, for the community.**

We need your help to keep this resource accurate, up-to-date, and visually stunning. Whether you're a lore master, a puzzle solver, or just have a great screenshot collection, there's a way for you to help.

## 🚨 Priority Missions (We need these NOW)

### 1. 📸 Visuals & Screenshots

**The Mission**: Many of our [Transmission](transmissions/overview.md) pages are text-heavy. We need high-quality images to bring them to life.

* **What to do**: Take clear screenshots of key moments in videos, tweets, or website easter eggs.
* **Where to put them**: Add them to the relevant Post pages in the `transmissions/posts/` folder.

### 2. 🎨 G\*Boy Special Examples

**The Mission**: We have basic info on the [G\*Boy Special](website.md#gboy-special-ai-tool), but we need to show what it can do.

* **What to do**: Create a gallery page or expand the section with:
  * Best "prompts" to get cool results.
  * Showcase of community-generated art.
  * Tips and tricks for the tool.

### 3. 🖼️ Community Art Spotlight

**The Mission**: Our community is incredibly creative. We need a dedicated space to showcase the best fan art, memes, and derivatives.

* **What to do**: Create a `community/art.md` page.
* **Content**: Curate the best art from X/Discord, credit the artists, and categorize them (e.g., "Hand-drawn", "AI Gen", "Memes").

## 🛠️ Ongoing Tasks

### 🧩 Puzzle Documentation

* **Unsolved Mysteries**: Check [Unsolved Mysteries](transmissions/unsolved.md) and see if you can crack a cold case.
* **Walkthroughs**: Write step-by-step guides for puzzles that have been solved but aren't fully documented yet.

### 📜 Lore Archiving

* **New Drops**: When a new video drops, help update the [Timeline](timeline.md) and [Lore](lore.md) pages immediately.
* **Transcriptions**: Write out the dialogue/audio from videos to make them searchable.
