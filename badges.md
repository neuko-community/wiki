## Badge Utility

**Current Status**: We currently do not know what the badge utility is. The team has not confirmed any specific utilities for the badges.

### What Badges Currently Represent

* **Early Supporter Credential**: Proof of being here first
* **Community Access**: Part of Neuko community
* **Lore Integration**: Part of the story/narrative

### Speculated Utility

While no utilities have been confirmed, community speculation includes:

* **AI Tools**: Potential access to AI-powered content creation tools
* **Generative Art**: Possible evolving or generative NFT features
* **Platform Access**: Future platform or product utilities
* **Future Drops**: Potential access to future distributions

**Status**: Utility is currently unknown - team emphasizes building over promises

## Community Distribution Story

### The Social Experiment

The Snake badge distribution was designed as a social experiment to test community values and loyalty:

**Setup**:

* Team gave Snake badges to Rabbit and Moth holders
* Gave holders complete freedom: Hold, Sell, or Give
* Holders were to distribute to people they thought would benefit the community
* No team oversight or control

**Community Response**:

* Most holders chose to give badges to community members
* Rewarded those who:
  * Interacted and engaged
  * Created content
  * Showed support
  * Helped onboard others
* Some bought badges on secondary markets to gift to others
* Community self-organized distribution channels

**Results**:

* Successful decentralized distribution
* Strong community cohesion
* Low sell pressure (2-3% listed)
* High conviction and loyalty
* Community-driven onboarding

**Significance**: Demonstrated that community values engagement and contribution over quick profits

## Badge Philosophy

### Transferable by Design

From founder [@SQU1NCH](https://x.com/SQU1NCH):

* Badges are fully transferable, sellable, "do-whatever-you-wantable"
* Team considered soul-bound tokens but chose transferability
* "Everything has a price" - free market approach
* Holders are free to sell if they want

### Meaning Over Utility

* Badges mean "you were here first"
* Badges mean "you believed early"
* "This is your in" - credential for early supporters
* Value comes from community and conviction, not forced utility

### Community Freedom

* No forced holding
* Free market is the best market
* Community decides value
* "Just be good to each other and stay safe"

## Badge Lore Integration

### Story Integration

* Badges represent test subjects/operatives in experiments
* G\*Boy (G304) escape causes "general chaos"
* Badge holders become "operatives" in the narrative
* Community actions woven into lore
