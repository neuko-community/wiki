# Neuko Community

> **High conviction, collaborative puzzle-solving, and a strong cultural identity.**

The Neuko community ("Operatives") is characterized by organic growth and deep engagement. Unlike typical "wen mint" discords, this community formed around solving puzzles, decoding lore, and a shared social experiment.

## Culture & Values

### Core Philosophy
*   **Engagement Over Extraction**: Rewards those who contribute, not just extract value.
*   **Collaboration Over Competition**: Puzzles are solved together in public threads.
*   **Diamond Hands**: Extremely low sell pressure (2-3% listed) despite a down market.

### Identity Markers
*   **Red Hoodie PFP**: Members adopt the "G*Boy" red hoodie as a visual tribe signal.
*   **Operative Designations**: Many use the format `OPERATIVE {Designation:; #:XXX}` in their bio.

### Memes & Rituals
*   **HEMLET**: Originating from a typo ("The helmet stays on" → "HEMLET"), this became an official brand element referenced by the team ("HEMLET CORP").
*   **Ribbit**: A community meme ("Frog Gummies") that was also acknowledged in official videos.
*   **Owl Hoots**: Audio shoutouts to community member @satoshi_owl in official transmissions.

## The "Snake Badge" Experiment

Phase 3 (Snake Badges) was a social experiment in **trust and distribution**.
*   **The Setup**: The team gave Snake badges to existing holders with zero instructions. They could Sell, Hold, or Gift.
*   **The Result**: The vast majority chose to **gift** them to active community members, effectively decentralizing the onboarding process.
*   **The Lesson**: This proved the community valued long-term growth and "skin in the game" over quick profits.

## Growth Stats (Nov 2025)

*   **Followers**: 0 → 13,000+ in ~4 weeks (100% organic).
*   **Mindshare**: ~0.25% (higher than many established blue chips).
*   **Holders**: 1,100+ unique badge holders.
*   **Listings**: <3% listed on marketplaces.
