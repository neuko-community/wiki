> The complete mythology, story, and narrative elements of Neuko.

## Overview

Neuko's lore centers on a cryptic conspiracy involving psychic experiments, a mysterious character known as G\*Boy (or G304), and a fictional corporation called MITER-Corp. The narrative unfolds through cryptic videos, puzzles, and community interpretation, creating a collaborative mythology that blends surveillance themes, government conspiracy tropes, and Web3 culture.

## The 1994 Archives (Variant G)

Discovered by "The Bloc" in November 2025, these archived video logs from September 1994 reveal the origin of G*Boy.

### The Experiments
*   **Subject**: Variant G (Series A) - a young boy
*   **Location**: Saint Juniper Research Campus (Sector 7)
*   **Tests**: Telekinetic abilities, EEG readings, stress tests
*   **Outcome**: Subject showed immense power but high instability. The footage confirms G*Boy was a child test subject.

### The Zion Campaign

*   **Goal**: To recruit a network of allies (operatives) outside the facility to aid G*Boy.
*   **Implication**: The community is not just observing; they are the "Zion" network activated to help the subject.
