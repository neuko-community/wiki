### Philosophy and Approach

**"Actions Over Words"**

* Emphasis on work product over vision statements
* Refusal to publish detailed roadmaps
* "We are nothing more than what we have collectively built"
* Belief that attention comes to those who earn it over the long run

**Anti-Mercenary Distribution**

* No paid influencers or KOLs
* No partnerships or backdoor deals
* No whitelist grinds
* Focus on organic, fair distribution

**Mystery-First Approach**

* "Neuko is in the eye of the beholder"
* No cheat sheet, no detailed roadmap, no textbook
* "The joy comes from the exploration of the unknown"
* Emphasis on discovery and interpretation

### Personal Origin Story

**Background**: Got into crypto in 2017 while working on music rights at Amazon\
**Experience**:

* Saw firsthand how centralized systems kept power concentrated at the top
* Discovered people trying to decentralize those systems
* Spent years helping independent artists leverage crypto
* Worked with early pioneers like Sound.xyz and Catalog
* Built tools for artists the traditional system told couldn't own their own music

**Philosophy**:

* "When appropriately leveraged, crypto can be an overwhelming force for good"
* Commitment to equitable systems, not extraction
* Belief in community resilience

### Key Quotes

> "We have tried to take a very different strategy. Actions over words (except my occasional ramblings here). Work product over vision statements."

> "We believe attention comes to those who earn it over the long run. That quantity only serves us when it is quality."

> "Neuko is in the eye of the beholder. It has plenty to say but only if you take the time to truly listen."

> "We do not seek to replicate playbooks because to do so would be inauthentic to who we are or how we seek to build."

> "We started Neuko with a core belief that there were other people like us. Who wanted to build fun shit on the internet with their friends."

### Badge Philosophy

**Transferable by Design**:

* Badges are fully transferable, sellable, "do-whatever-you-wantable"
* Team considered soul-bound tokens but chose transferability
* "Everything has a price" - free market approach
* Holders are free to sell if they want

**Meaning Over Utility**:

* Badges mean "you were here first"
* Badges mean "you believed early"
* "This is your in" - credential for early supporters
* Value comes from community and conviction

**Community Freedom**:

* "You are free" - no forced holding
* "A free market is the best market"
* "Just be good to each other and stay safe"

***

### Key Quotes

> "these tokens are fully transferable, sellable, do-whatever-you-wantable."

> "they mean you were here first. they mean you believed early. this is your in."

> "but the most the most important thing of all, is you are free."

> "so if you don't want to keep your badge, sell it. a free market is the best market."

### Community Appreciation

**Tribute to Community**:

* Recognition of people who show up, build, create, share
* Acknowledgment of those fighting battles no one sees
* Appreciation for energy to believe despite challenges

**Community Conviction**:

* "the fact that what we've built even makes selling an impossible choice for people is humbling"
* "anyone could sell and quietly exit, but they stay because this means something to them"
* "but the truth is, we didn't build that part. you did."

**Community Support**:

* "this community has supported each other like none i've ever seen"
* "it has so much heart. the people here are real and they're all fucking beautiful"
* "people here create for each other, lift each other up, and pour energy into everything they touch"

***

### Key Quotes

> "been thinking a lot about the people that make [@neukoai](https://x.com/neukoai) what it is. the ones who show up, build, create, share, and hold on when it'd be easier to walk away."

> "we gave people a reason to join, but you give them a reason to stay."

## Team Philosophy

### Building Approach

**Quality Over Quantity**:

* "We will not fall victim to the trappings of feeling the need to always say something"
* "To explain what we are. To define and box ourselves in when the joy comes from the exploration of the unknown"
* Emphasis on quality content over constant posting

**Organic Growth**:

* No paid promotions
* No partnerships or KOL deals
* 100% organic engagement
* "Actions speak loudly"

**Community First**:

* Building for community, not mercenaries
* Building for long-term, not quick flip
* Building for equity, not extraction
* "We're building something designed for equity, not extraction"

### Doodles Background

**Experience**: 5/5 founders are ex-Doodles team members\
**Track Record**:

* Proven ability to build NFT IP
* Experience with community building
* Speaking at major events (NFT Paris, Accelerate Art, Solana Accelerate)
* Understanding of Web3 culture and dynamics

**Why Leave**:

* "When we left Doodles we thought long and hard about if we wanted to stay in Web3"
* "This space can be unforgiving. To build something of substance that lasts feels like a mountain few have climbed"
* Belief that there were others like them who wanted to build differently

***

### Communication Style

**Minimal Public Communication**:

* Zero interviews to date
* Only one (silent) space
* "We want our actions to speak loudly"
* "There will be times to talk (like Breakpoint!) but most of the time is better spent building"

* Involving community members in puzzles
* Shoutouts and recognition for contributors
