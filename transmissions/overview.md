# Transmissions

> Complete catalog of every Neuko X post/video with detailed breakdowns, puzzle clues, lore elements, and community reactions.

## Overview

Neuko communicates primarily through X (Twitter) posts and videos. Each transmission contains layers of meaning: visual storytelling, hidden puzzles, lore reveals, and community engagement. Puzzles are directly integrated into the videos themselves, making each post both content and challenge.
