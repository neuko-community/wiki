## Video & Description

{% embed url="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F5VvgOYQg7lBopCK10lUB%2Fuploads%2F9D8EBOpDS2GvWdObT1lg%2Fpost_2025_11_14.mp4?alt=media&token=4d9be8fd-b43e-470a-bc02-3de7d3e1e0d3" %}

*   **Visuals**: Grainy, CCTV-style footage of the Saint Juniper Research Campus.
*   **Audio**: Alarms blaring, distant panic, garbled radio communications.
*   **Scenes**: Empty corridors with papers scattered, flickering lights, "Sector 7" signage.
*   **Atmosphere**: Chaos, aftermath of a breach or escape.

## Puzzle Elements

### Audio Decoding
*   **Discovery**: Community members cleaned up the audio track.
*   **Reveal**: Dialogue of lab personnel panicking about "Subject G304" and a "Sector 7 lockdown".
*   **Lore**: Confirms the chaos caused by G*Boy's escape.

### Terminal Flash
*   **Visual**: A computer terminal screen flashes briefly.
*   **Text**: "SJ-SECURELAB DETECTED - User ID: node04 - Access Key: v5.12.03 - MOTH..."
*   **Solution**: This was a direct instruction. "MOTH" referred to Moth badge holders. The "Access Key" was the version number found in earlier logs.
*   **Outcome**: Led users to try logging into the [sj-securelab.net](https://sj-securelab.net) portal using their badges.

## Puzzle/Lore Hooks

*   **Direct Action**: First time the video explicitly gave a "key" (MOTH) to interact with the website.
*   **The Breach**: Sets the stage for "The Bloc" to hack the system.
*   **G304**: Reaffirms G*Boy's designation and threat level.

## Community Reactions

*   **"We're In"**: Excitement as Moth holders realized they were the "key".
*   **Formation of The Bloc**: The technical challenge of using the badge auth led to the formation of the "Bloc" hacker group.

## Significance

Kicked off the "Secure Lab Hack" event, transitioning the community from passive observers to active intruders in the MITER-Corp system.
