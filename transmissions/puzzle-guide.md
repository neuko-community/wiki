# Neuko Puzzle Guide

> **"The joy comes from the exploration of the unknown."**

Puzzles are the core engagement engine of Neuko. They are not just fun diversions; they are social experiments designed to test collaboration, conviction, and attention to detail.

## Philosophy
*   **No Cheat Sheet**: The team will never give a direct answer. Discovery is the product.
*   **Collaborative**: Puzzles are often too hard for one person. They require the "hive mind" to solve.
*   **Integrated**: Real community members are often woven into the puzzles (e.g., receiving codes to distribute).

## Common Techniques

If you want to be an Operative, you need to know how to look.

### 1. Audio Spectrograms
**What to look for**: Images hidden in sound waves.
**How to solve**: Download the video's audio and run it through a spectrogram viewer (like Audacity or online tools).
**History**: First discovered by **[@0xstateoftheart](https://x.com/0xstateoftheart)** in Post #5.

### 2. Visual Contrast Codes
**What to look for**: Hidden text that only appears when brightness/contrast is manipulated.
**How to solve**: Take screenshots of dark or glitchy scenes. Crank up the exposure and contrast in Photoshop/GIMP.
**History**: Used in Post #7 to hide code words like "HOOTS-49".

### 3. Website Console Logs
**What to look for**: Hidden messages in the browser's developer console.
**How to solve**: Go to [neuko.ai](https://neuko.ai), right-click -> Inspect -> Console. Look for text logs or hidden `.txt` files.
