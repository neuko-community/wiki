## Neuko.ai (The Portal)

The Neuko website ([neuko.ai](https://neuko.ai)) is a minimalistic, puzzle-gated portal that serves as both a teaser and a puzzle layer. The site features a PIN unlock system requiring codes discovered through video puzzles. Hidden console logs with lore and directives were discovered on [sj-securelab.net](https://sj-securelab.net/) in the `/dir` directory.

### Website Structure

**Public View**

**Design**: Minimalistic, retro-futuristic aesthetic  
**Elements**:
- "NEUKO" title
- Logo: Three yellow figures on red background
- TV frame aesthetic
- "Unlock" section with "Enter PIN to unlock" prompt
- No visible lore, team info, or multimedia beyond unlock interface

**Purpose**: Designed as a locked portal requiring puzzle-solving to access deeper content

## PIN Unlock System

### How It Works

**Requirement**: Enter PIN to unlock website access  
**Discovery Process**: 
1. Solve puzzles in videos (Post #7 - Channel Flipping)
2. Identify community shoutouts
3. Extract hidden contrast codes
4. Get code parts from community members
5. Combine codes to form PIN

### PIN Components

**Codes Discovered** (from Post #7):
- **HOOTS-49**: From [@satoshi_owl](https://x.com/satoshi_owl) (owl hoots in audio)
- **HOPS-13**: From [@CharliegNFTeth](https://x.com/CharliegNFTeth) (frog gummies)
- **STAYS-28**: From [@TheKeeperOfX](https://x.com/TheKeeperOfX) (HEMLET CORP radios)

**Combination**: These codes combine to form the website PIN
